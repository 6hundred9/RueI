The [RueI](./RueI.html) namespace contains classes shared across all of RueI. Generally, you shouldn't need to use the classes and interfaces within this namespace. The exception is the [RueIMain](./RueI.RueIMain.html) class that
contains the [EnsureInit()](./RueI.RueIMain.html?q=Ensure#RueI_RueIMain_EnsureInit) method, which should be called by any plugin using RueI upon being loaded.
