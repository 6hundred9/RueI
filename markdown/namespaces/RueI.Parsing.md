The [RueI.Parsing](./RueI.Parsing.html) namespace contains a large number of classes mostly used internally by RueI. Notably, classes within this namespace can be used to create [custom tags](../markdown/customtags.html). Additionally, if you want to calculate and parse hints, you can use this namespace.
