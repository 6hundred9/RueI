# Introduction
RueI is a hint framework for scp:sl. the primary component of RueI is the ability to display multiple hints at once, but it also provides a lot of other features to make working with hints easier and more effective.

a quick note: RueI is licensed under CC0 1.0. this means you can do *whatever* you want with both its compiled versions and its source code. commerical use, modifications, etc, are all okay!

RueI is a **dependency**. it is a not a plugin. this means that it does not provide any functionality out of the box. other plugins will not work automatically once you install this if they do not have built-in support for RueI.
