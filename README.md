# RueI
[![build](https://github.com/Ruemena/RueI/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Ruemena/RueI/actions/workflows/main.yml)

RueI is a hint framework for scp:sl

docs are available [here](https://ruemena.github.io/RueI/).

### Features
- support for displaying multiple hints at once without them interfering with eachother
- cross-plugin compatibility 
- custom tags and other utility
- scheduler system, which makes dealing with the hint ratelimit easier

RueI is not a grid-based or line-based system, it calculates the offset necessary to put a hint at the same position no matter what
