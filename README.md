RueI is a hint framework, designed to be the definitive way to display multiple hints at once. you can get the latest release [here](https://github.com/misfiy/RueI/releases/latest).

docs are available [here](https://ruemena.github.io/RueI/).

### Features
- support for displaying multiple hints at once without them interfering with eachother
- cross-plugin compatibility 
- custom tags and other utility
- scheduler system, which makes dealing with the hint ratelimit easier

RueI is not a grid-based or line-based system, it calculates the offset necessary to put a hint at the same position no matter what
